When you go into the **Brawl Stars** app right after its download, it will take you to the starting map. You will need to collect gems using the movement joystick on the bottom left of the screen. It is recommended to use the left hand thumb to move it. 

After you have acquired all the gems, four bots will appear, as well as a red attack joystick. The _Shelly_ in the top right of screen will tell you to drag the joystick and defeat the bots. It is best to use your right hand thumb for this. 

Once you have defeated all the enemy bots, more will appear. You must then tap the red joystick to defeat them, which is called quickfiring, or as I like to call it, auto-aiming. Then a new yellow joystick will appear. This is your super joystick. It is a special attack that charges after you deal a certain amount of damage. This is different for every brawler. Also, below your health (the green bar), there are three orange bars. They are your ammo. When they are orange, it means you have ammo. If they are black and empty, it means you are out of ammo.

In the last stage of the tutorial, a boss bot will appear. You must drag your super joystick (with your right thumb) and aim at it. Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial. Then you choose your name. After that, you must play one match of gem grab to unlock the full version of the game. This is against bots, who are very bad at the game. Then you will get a brawl box from the trophy road(top left), and upgrade _Shelly_. It will ask you to try out your uprade with another battle. Do it. Then you will get another trohpy road reward, which is a brawler named Nita. Try it out.
